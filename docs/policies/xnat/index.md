## About XNAT

XNAT is an open-source imaging informatics platform developed at Washington University with a deployment here at UAB. It facilitates both MRI data storage in a common structure as well as sharing across labs both internal and external to UAB. It is free to use for all researchers at UAB. More information can be found at [xnat.org](https://www.xnat.org).

## Why Use XNAT

- Can send data directly from the scanner to XNAT without copying to flash drive
- Easy to add collaborators to projects and share data across labs
- Can act as a data backup
- Common storage system makes data preprocessing pipelines more generalizeable
